Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript


An object is a collection of properties, and a property is an association between a name (or key) and a value.
A property's value can be a function, in which case the property is known as a method.
A javaScript object has properties associatd with it. A property of an object can be explained as
variable that is attacched to the object.

Internal Reprasentation/syntax:

const objectName = {
 key : "value"
}

properties of JavaScript objects can also be accessed or set using a bracket notation and can also be accessed using dot notation.

Ex:

1) objecName['key'] = "value";
2) objectName.key
