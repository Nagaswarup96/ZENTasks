Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2


HTTP/2 is developed with the intention of reducing web page load latency by using techniques such as compression, multiplexing, and prioritization.
HTTP/1.1 keeps all requests nad responses in plain text format, HTTP/2 uses the binary farming layer to encapsulate all messages in binary format.
But still maintains HTTP semantics, such as verbs, methods and headers. An appllication level API would still create messages in the conventional HTTP formats,
but the underlying layer would then convert these messages into binary.HTTP/1.1 allows persistent connections and pipelining, that it assumes that a TCP connection should be kept 
open unless directly told to close. HTTP/2 binary farming layer encodes requests/responses and cuts them up into smaller packets of information, greatly increasing the 
flexibility of data transfer.
